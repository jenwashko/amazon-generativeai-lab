## Studio Local Generative AI

This section of the repository is dedicated to code samples that demonstrate how to experiment with generative AI models locally in SageMaker Studio using Studio Notebooks. Here, you will find a sample codebase that leverages a myriad of GenAI models to create a wide range of use cases.

### What's SageMaker Studio Notebook?

Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks are collaborative notebooks that you can launch quickly because you don't need to set up compute instances and file storage beforehand. A set of instance types, known as Fast launch types are designed to launch in under two minutes. Studio notebooks provide persistent storage, which enables you to view and share notebooks even if the instances that the notebooks run on are shut down.

You can share your notebooks with others, so that they can easily reproduce your results and collaborate while building models and exploring your data. You provide access to a read-only copy of the notebook through a secure URL. Dependencies for your notebook are included in the notebook's metadata. When your colleagues copy the notebook, it opens in the same environment as the original notebook.
