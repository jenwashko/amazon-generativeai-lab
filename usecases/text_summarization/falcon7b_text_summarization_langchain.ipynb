    " There are two main types of methods for summarizing text: abstractive and extractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization generates a new shorter summary in its own words based on understanding the meaning and concepts of the original text. It analyzes the text using advanced natural language techniques to grasp the key ideas and then expresses those ideas in a summarized form using different words and phrases. This is similar to how humans summarize by reading something and then explaining the main points in their own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization works by selecting the most important sentences, phrases or words from the original text to construct a summary. It calculates the weight or importance of each part of the text using algorithms and then chooses the parts with the highest weights to put into the summary. This pulls summarizes by extracting key elements from the text itself rather than interpreting the meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short, abstractive summarization rewrites the key ideas in new words while extractive summarization selects the most salient parts of the existing text. Both aim to distill the essence and most significant information from the original document into a condensed summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to run through 3 methods for summarization that start with basic prompting to summarizing large documents using `map_reduce` method. These aren't the only options, feel free to modify it based on your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3 Levels Of Summarization:**\n",
    "1. **Summarize a couple sentences** - Basic Prompt\n",
    "2. **Summarize a couple paragraphs** - Prompt Templates\n",
    "3. **Summarize a large document with multiple pages** - Map Reduce\n",

      " Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n",
      " \n",
      " The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n",

      "As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\n",
      " \n",
      " YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.\n",
